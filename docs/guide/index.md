# svelte-draggable-plus

Why is it named `svelte-draggable-plus`? Well, it's named that way to align with `vue-draggable-plus`.

## Introduction

`svelte-draggable-plus` is a draggable sorting plugin based on [`Sortablejs`](https://github.com/SortableJS/Sortable), wrapped as a component for easy use within the Svelte framework. You can use it to implement drag-and-drop sorting.

## Installation

```bash
npm install svelte-draggable-plus sortablejs
```

If your project uses TypeScript, you can also install `@types/sortablejs` to benefit from type support.

```bash
npm install @types/sortablejs -D
```
